# Anoma Intent Bazaar (Demo)

Single-file, no-build demo that showcases intent-centric matching and a natural-language “intent robot” planner
(simulated off-chain). No wallet, no RPCs, no dependencies.

## Features

- NL planner: `swap 10 usdt on base to atom on cosmos` → swap/bridge/swap plan with estimated output
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS; works offline
